/**
 * Infix expression:The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is
 * in-between every pair of operands.
 * 
 * Postfix expression:The expression of the form a b op. When an operator is
 * followed for every pair of operands.
 * 
 * Why postfix representation of the expression? The compiler scans the
 * expression either from left to right or from right to left.
 * 
 * Consider the below expression: a op1 b op2 c op3 d If op1 = +, op2 = *, op3 =
 * +
 * 
 * The compiler first scans the expression to evaluate the expression b * c,
 * then again scan the expression to add a to it. The result is then added to d
 * after another scan.
 * 
 * The repeated scanning makes it very in-efficient. It is better to convert the
 * expression to postfix(or prefix) form before evaluation.
 * 
 * The corresponding expression in postfix form is: abc*+d+.
